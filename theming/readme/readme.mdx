## Theming in Bit

This example includes a demo of how to do theming in React and Bit using a theme provider and various themes.

The aim is to make it easier for designers and developers to be able to seamlessly collaborate. Currently, designers deal in [design tokens](https://bit.dev/learn-bit-react/theming/themes/theme-provider/~code/default-theme-tokens.tsx) (key-value pairs) and developers in javascript code, but there's no way to directly convert from one to the other without manual changes.

With this [Theme Provider](https://bit.dev/learn-bit-react/theming/themes/theme-provider/~code/default-theme-tokens.tsx), design tokens can be exported from tools such as Figma, in JSON format, and then used as-is in Bit inside a theme component.

```js
{
  "MyColorText": "red"
}
```

The Theme Provider automatically converts json formatted design tokens to useful CSS formats, both modular and direct CSS variables, which are then translated into a theme which can be used in your app. Essentially, it bridges the entire gap between raw tokens to fully-themed code.

```css
color: var(--my-color-text);
```

The example also includes a [button component](https://bit.dev/learn-bit-react/theming/example/button) which demonstrates the CSS from tokens, being used with both [CSS variables](https://bit.dev/learn-bit-react/theming/example/button/~code/button.module.scss) and CSS-in-JS, as well as examples of creating and using multiple themes for varied branding across an organisation.

```js
<button className={style.button}>Default Theme</button>
<button style={{ color: 'var(--my-color-text)' }}>Default Theme</button>
<button style={{ color: defaultTheme.myColorText }}>Default Theme</button>

```
